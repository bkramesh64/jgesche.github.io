Another Arduino humidity sensor - Why?

There are a lot of projects on the internet that describe how to use
Arduinos or Raspberry PIs to sense humidity or temperature.
However, none of these projects satisfied my requirements:

- limited available space.
- no external power available
- must run on batteries for more than one year
- stream measurements to an internet accessible database
- radio signal must be able to penetrate multiple thick concrete walls

Obviously I had to design my own circuit board according to my requirements.
Designing an IoT device has been on my To-Do list for quite a while, so this was the
perfect opportunity to give it a try.

The project can be broken down in the following steps:
 1. PCB design
 2. PCB testing
 3. Casing design
 4. Developing a receiver for the sensor data
 5. Software development for the sensors and receiver
 6. Development of an application which allows easy analysis of the data
