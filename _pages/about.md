My name is Julian Gesche from Düsseldorf, Germany. Recently I finished my graduate studies at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Mechanical and Process Engineering. I am passionate about programming, kitesurfing, aviation and traveling.

In high school, I studied one year abroad in New Zealand. There, I had the opportunity to get my pilots license. The practical flying experiences were an excellent foundation for my undergraduate studies in mechanical and aerospace engineering at the Technische Universität Darmstadt. I focused on aerodynamics and jet propulsion and wrote my Bachelor thesis about computational fluid dynamics. I used the CFD open source toolbox OpenFOAM to simulate the manipulation of leading-edge vortex detachment by means of plasma actuation.

 During a year abroad at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I shifted my focus to control systems engineering. As a member of a small research team I had the opportunity to develop  a simulation environment for unmanned air vehicle under the supervision of Prof. M. Selig. This project sparked my interest in software development.  I started learning Python in my free time and worked on several programming related side projects.


I wrote my master thesis on predictive maintenance machine learning algorithms. I implemented two algorithms to predict the degradation of rolling element bearings in electric motors. The first approach employed Gaussian Process regression and a Particle Filter to propagate the degradation state of a bearing in time. The second approach was based on an Echo State Network, which was optimized by differential evolution.
I will dedicate several blog posts to predictive maintenance and how to implement various prediction algorithms in Python. There are a lot of books, papers and blog posts on this topic available. However, I could not find a single resource which offered a hands-on introduction to PHM. My blog will hopefully close this gap.


 The timeframe of 6 months, which is dedicated to writing a master thesis in Germany is not long enough to thoroughly explore a topic. After having handed in my thesis I decided to continue to study everything related to predictive maintenance, machine learning, and data science. Thus I dedicated another 6 months to a full-time, self-curated curriculum of statistics textbooks, machine learning competitions and finally this blog.
Over the next weeks, I will upload posts which will summarize my activities, experiences, and findings over the past month.
