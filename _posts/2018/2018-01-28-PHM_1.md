Introduction to Predictive Maintenance
======================================

Maintenance strategies play a vital role in the life cycle of machinery. Traditional maintenance philosophies can be broadly classified into preventive and corrective maintenance. Preventive strategies rely on time intervals that are derived from statistics (MTBF) to trigger maintenance activities. Corrective maintenance is performed after failure detection. Both approaches have financial implications stemming from factors such as machinery downtime or the replacement of components before the end of their lifetime. Key technology trends that are going to define the future of the industry are Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud Computing. The aviation industry has already begun to implement these new technologies. The jet engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney applies Big Data to develop predictive maintenance methods. The new P&W geared Turbo Fan engine is fitted with 5000 sensors, and they expect that these engines will stream up to 2 petabytes of data annually. By combining data with advanced analytics, P&W can predict maintenance events ahead of time and reduce the number of unplanned events. According to the IATA Airline Cost Management Group, predictive maintenance will increase aircraft availability by up to 35% and decrease MRO spendings by 15% to 20 %. Advanced maintenance concepts will, therefore, continue to feature prominently in improving industry competitiveness.

The first couple of post will focus on the implementation and evaluation of two independent data-driven prognostic algorithms. The objective of these algorithms is to predict the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of rolling element bearings in induction motors. The majority of RUL prediction algorithm use bearing vibration signals as an input feature. However, the acquisition of vibration signals requires additional hardware and sensors. Oftentimes, the induction motors are mounted in inaccessible places. Induction motor current spectrum analysis is a promising alternative. The current spectrum contains potential fault information and can easily an without great cost be monitored and analyzed. Motor control and protection hardware usually already equipped with current monitoring modules. The two algorithms are developed with the aim of using the stator current as an input feature to predict the RUL of induction motor bearings.

The first algorithm uses Gaussian Process (GP) regression for state model update computation and a Particle Filter (PF) for state estimation and multi-step ahead prediction. The advantage of combing the GP and PF is the ability of the algorithm to provide a prediction with confidence bounds. PF based models are an established prognostic approach but have been applied for the first time for stator current based RUL prediction. To increase the accuracy and robustness an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) approach is fused with the GP and PF. The IMM allows us to combine PFs with different state update models. It is assumed that the model performance increases as the complexity of the model increases. The second algorithm is based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In a RNN connection between the internal node form direct cycles, which enable the network to capture and store dynamic temporal behavior. Therefore, RNNs perform well on pattern recognition tasks which are based on the sequential temporal information. RNNs have been proposed with different architectures and underlying learning algorithms. However, practitioners of the industry considered the application of RNNs until recently as difficult. RNN learning is difficult to control and the convergence of the optimization algorithms is not always guaranteed. In response, Jaeger et. al  propose the Echo State Network (ESN). The ESN uses linear regression for learning. It has been successfully used for the prediction and classification of temporal sequences. Therefore, the Echo State network seems to be a promising for the application of RUL prediction

Prognostic and health Management (PHM)
======================================

PHM is a key enabling concept in the field of maintenance management and predictive maintenance that allows life-cycle cost reduction and improved maintenance on a system-level. Two additional concepts which are often referred to in the context of PHM are condition-based maintenance (CBM) and condition monitoring (CM). Each concept has a specific objective in the field of predictive maintenance.
 To carry out preventive or predictive maintenance it is necessary to have knowledge about the condition of a machine at any time of its lifecycle. Monitoring systems detect and diagnose changes in machinery parameters that indicate wear and imminent failure of a machine.\\
 Condition-based maintenance is primarily a decision making strategy for maintenance. The decision is based on results obtained through CM. CBM triggers a maintenance event if the condition of a component or system requires service [18]. Main features of CBM systems are real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Research on CBM methods led to improvements in sensor technology and data collection methods as well as to the development of new algorithms and data analysis technologies [16].

Integral parts of CBM are diagnostic capabilities. Diagnostic algorithms monitor degradation and detect faults by identifying specific signals caused by the monitored degradation feature. Apart from fault detection, diagnostic algorithms often have the capabilities to identify the failed system (Fault isolation) and determine the failure mechanism (Fault identification).
The next stage in the evolution of maintenance is Prognostic and Health Management (PHM).\\
PHM is an upcoming discipline which merges the fields of prognostics and the field of health management. Health management refers to intelligent proactive maintenance based on diagnostic and prognostic information. It dictates all activities related to the optimization of the maintenance process during the whole life cycle. Prognostics is the ability to estimate the time until failure or RUL of machinery. Figure 1. illustrates differences between CM, CBM and PHM. PHM does not provide monitoring (CM) or maintenance concepts, therefore CBM is usually adopted as a basis for PHM.
\\
PHM is widely used in engineering and in particular in the aerospace sector. Prominent projects like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter utilize PHM as a central concept. NASA is also actively researching PHM technologies for deployment in their spacecraft. PHM can be beneficial throughout the whole life cycle of a system such as development, design, production, operations, and maintenance [17]. Some selected key benefits are:

-   Increased systems safety

-   Improve operational reliability

-   Extend service life of the system

-   Reduce the occurrence of no fault found

To summarize, PHM is a holistic approach to maintenance when combined
with condition-based maintenance. However, PHM is still under active
research and a number of technological and methodical issues needs to be
resolved. The development of prognostic algorithms is one of the major
challenges.

The Prognostics framework
----------------------------

Prognostics can be defined as proposed by the International Organization
for Standardization: \"Prognostics is the estimation of time to failure
and risk for one or more existing and future failure modes\" [5]. In
practice, prognostics involve the detection of a failure precursor
followed by a prediction of the RUL [15]. The RUL is the time
span until a component cannot operate anymore within its given
specifications. Prognostics can be implemented for a given system at
different levels of abstraction. The prognostic model can be applied to
a single component, a sub-system or the entire system [7].
Predictive maintenance relies on two modeling approaches: Regression or
Classification. Regression predicts the RUL whereas classification
predicts whether a component has reached a certain degradation state. A
combination of both approaches is also possible. [10]
The RUL prediction procedure is illustrated in the left plot in Fig.
2 for a one dimensional signal. The
prediction starts at time $$t_$$, which is a point in time after the
initial detection of degradation. The point estimate for the RUL is then
computed as the remaining time between $$t_p$$ and the predicted time
$$t_{FTH}$$ when the signal crosses a failure threshold (FTH). Crossing of
the FTH does not necessarily imply a failure of the machinery. As
defined earlier the component cannot operate anymore within the given
specifications. The remaining useful lifetime at prediction time $$t_p$$
is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*} RUL(t_p)=t_{EOL}-t_p \end{align*}
$$

where $$t_p$$ is a known value and $$t_{EOL}$$ is a random function of the
failure threshold and the state estimate.  The right plot in Fig. 2 depicts the RUL estimation and the respective
confidence bounds at different points in time. As more data becomes available
over time the accuracy of the RUL estimation should increase.

Failure threshold definition
----------------------------

Prognostic models for RUL estimation require the definition of a precise
failure threshold (FTH). As we have previously defined, the RUL is the time
between the start of prediction and the time at which the predicted feature crosses the FTH.
The definition of the FTH introduces an additional source of uncertainty
to the prediction model. The FTH can be different for every component
and varies under different environmental and load conditions. Therefore,
the FTH should be defined by a probabilistic value rather than a
deterministic one.
The increased error of the RUL estimation that is caused by the FTH
definition, can be reduced by using multidimensional features. A discrete
state classifier can set the FTH dynamically, when multidimensional
features are used. The classifier assumes discrete states of degradation
and sets the threshold for continuous state predictor accordingly.
However, this approach pre-assumes discrete states which might not be
accurate. The discrete degradation states will be different for every
machine. Unsupervised classifiers are a viable alternative in the
absence of a ground truth (labels) for the classification of the
degradation state and ultimately the FTH [7].

Model based prognostics
-----------------------

Model-based or physics-based approaches rely on mathematical
representations to model degradation of systems. These models are based
on knowledge about the degradation process. They usually incorporate
fundamental theories on the material level like crack-growth models or
gas path models. Furthermore, these model usually require knowledge
about load, operation conditions as well as components geometry and
material properties.[13]\
However, knowledge about geometry and material might not always be
available. The development is comparable to other approaches very
time-consuming. Physics-based models might be inaccurate in a dynamic
operating environment due to assumptions and errors made in the design
process. An approach for mitigating this problem is the combination of
physics-based models with data-driven approaches. Such an approach
allows dynamic updating of model parameters. The integration of physics
and data-based approaches are called hybrid approach.

Data-driven prognostics
-----------------------

Data-driven prognostic methods translate collected monitoring data (like
vibration, temperature, current, pressure, voltage) into behavioural
models of the considered system. The states that describe the behavioural
model are in many cases hidden/not observable [7]. For these
techniques, only monitoring data is required in contrast to the prior
knowledge that is required for the physics-based approach. This
requirement is also a major challenge for data-driven techniques since
data quality and sample size has a major influence on these methods. For
some applications it is not possible to obtain degradation progression
data since components in industrial application can usually not run
until failure due to their system criticality or their failure mode.
Data-driven models can be classified into two categories: machine learning and
statistical approaches [13]. Note that there is no general agreement
on how to classify Data-driven models. For instances Dragomir et. al. [3]
distinguishes between artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical approaches.


**Machine learning approaches:**


Machine learning is a branch of AI that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and capture complex relationships within data.
We distinguish four different training methods: supervised, unsupervised training, semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. For known training output, the learning process is supervised. Supervised learning enables us to find a model that connects the input or attribute variables with the output or the dependent variable. Unsupervised is applied to datasets where the output is unlabelled. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find meaningful patterns or structure within data. A mixed dataset of labeled and unlabelled data is called semi-supervised learning. The fourth technique is reinforcement learning which has the task of finding a solution that maximizes a possible reward. The outputs are not dictated like in supervised learning but must be discovered by the algorithm [1]. The machine learning algorithms used in the next couple of blog posts on PHM are based on supervised learning. The two central problems in supervised learning are regression and classification. The difference between regression and classification is the type of the dependent variable. In regression, the dependent variable is a continuous or numerical value and in classification it is categorical.
  Another possibility to classify machine learning algorithms is by similarity [2]:
- Connectionist methods (ANN, RNN)
- Bayesian methods: Explicit application of Bayes' Theorem
- Instance based learning (K-nearest-neighbours)
- Combination methods


**Statistical approaches**

Statistical prognostic methods fit a probabilistic model to data to generate a state estimation. A few selected methods are:

- multivariate statistical methods (static and dynamic principle components (PCA),
- linear and quadratic discriminant
- signal analysis (auto-regressive models, FFT)

Within this classification Bayesian techniques can be allocated to both machine learning or statistical approaches.
A detailed list of implementations of statistical prognostic algorithms can be found in [3].

Machine learning has the advantage over physics-based models that the development and implementation process is comparatively short.
Among the Machine Learning approaches RNN seem to be the most promising techniques for RUL estimation. Their internal structure enables them to perform temporal processing and learn sequences. A variety of RNN based prognostic techniques have been proposed in literature. An Adaptive Recurrent Neural Network for Remaining  Useful Life Prediction of Lithium-ion Batteries was recently developed by Liu et. al, [11]. However, the implementation and the training process of RNNs is challenging which led to the development of Reservoir Computing (RC). One instance of RC are Echo State Networks which consist of a reservoir with sparsely connected neurones and a trainable output layer. ESN have been used by Morando et. al. [12] for the prediction of the RUL of a proton exchange membranes and Fuel Cells. Most recently Rigamonti et. al proposed an ESN for the RUL prediction of a turbofan engine. Based on this previous work the ESN qualifies as a promising algorithm for RUL prediction. However, ESN as well as comes with their own sets of drawbacks. They usually only compute point predictions without confidence bounds. Since it is necessary to account for uncertainty in the PHM framework, connections methods are by default of limited usefulness. Recently new methods like Bayesian Neural Network were proposed which introduce probabilistic capabilities to neural networks [4].

The Bayesian framework allows us to express the probability of a hypothesis based on prior probability, the probability of observing data and the data itself. For RUL estimation we want to calculate the probability density function that describes the degradation. This task is usually referred to as recursive Bayesian estimation or Bayes' filtering. Most commonly used Bayes' techniques are Kalman and particle filter (PF) [8].  PF based approaches have been widely used for RUL-estimation. Saha et. al  [14] used a PF to predict the remaining capacity of a battery for current and future cycles. A more recent PF based approaches were presented by Jouin et. al [6]. Their research investigated the estimation of PEM-fuel cell degradation using a parametric description of the underlying process to define the state model.
Parametric models are however limited and might not be able to capture the dynamics of the process. A non-parametric solution for learning the state and prediction models is the  Gaussian Process regression model. Gaussian Process models have been successfully applied to a variety of problems [8] [9].
The combination of the GP with a PF has been proposed by Ko et. al.[8]. Their results suggest that the GP+PF is a promising approach for RUL-estimation.
